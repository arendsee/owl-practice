# Logic languages

This repository is intended to be for the study of OWL. But, since I don't
really have any other place for these notes, I will overload it with general
logic language material. 

Here I will maintain a list of notes on specific logic languages.

Categories:

 * Rules-with-actions - Jess and Drools
   * Production rule systems - Jess, Drools, JRules (IBM)
   * reactive / event-condition-action - 

## Jess

A proprietary Java-based rule engine

## Drools

A Java-based rules management system and Eclipse plugin

# RuleML

See [RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Reaction_RuleML_1.02),
I ought to go over 1.1 from this link, and figure out what all the features
mean.
