# Rule Interchange Format (RIF)

[See W3 notes here](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-rif-overview-20130205/)

RIF is not a rule language, but rather a set of protocols for converting
between rule languages. There are three basic classes of rule systems.

 1. first-order
 2. logic-programming
 3. action-rules
