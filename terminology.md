# Terminology

 * existential variable - `Exists(x) such that ...` -- `x` is an existential variable -- see existential quantification

 * reification (computer science) - transformation of an abstract computational
   concept into a concrete data model. "Making something a first-class
   citizen".

 * reflection - The ability to examine and modify ones own structure at
   runtime. For example, in R you can access the abstract syntax tree for an
   expression and alter it. Expressions are not run until the need to be
   (laziness) and in the mean time their code can be accessed.

 * conceptual analysis

 * knowledge representation

 * skolem constants

 * reified terms
