# Relationships

Figuring out all the terminology, let alone the theory, in the logic and type
systems world, is quite a piece of work. Here I will try to define sets of
synonymous terms (trivially identical), equivalent ideas (non-trivially
identical), and subset relations.

## Synonyms

 * L0, zeroth-order logic, propositional calculus, propositional logic,
   statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic

| L1               | OWL        | DL         |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| concept          | individual | individual |
| Unary predicate  | class      | concept    |
| Binary predicate | property   | role       |

## Equivalent

## Ordered

 1. By expressivity

    * L0 < DL < L1
