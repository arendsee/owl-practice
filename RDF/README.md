# RDFS

Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) is not OWL. But it is a related
language based on frame logic.

Here I will try to get something, anything, working.

# Notes from Practical RDF

This is an old book, from 2003, but perhaps starting with old material is not
so damning a choice, as it is closer to the roots and written be people who
watched the concept grow and who had not yet had time to rewrite their
memories.

Some of the book really is too old to be userful. The querying section, for
instance, predates SPARQL. But the first 6 chapters should be worthile.

## Chapter 1 - introduction

 * RDF: Resource Description Framework
 * RDF is to the semantic web as HTML is to the old web
 * RDF was specified in 1997
 * Originally written by Ora Lassila and Ralph Swick
 * XML is a tree, RDF is a directed graph
