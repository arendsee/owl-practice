# OWL practice

OWL feels like another world, a little like Prolog. I roughly understand the
ideas in OWL, is a knowledge representation system based on descriptive logic.
But I don't quite get how to, well, use it. There are many representations and
many reasoners.

My first goal here is to get a workflow going for writing OWL ontologies and
then find an appropriate CLI tool for making inferences based on them.

I think I will start by writing them in XML. This is pretty ugly, but if the
most universally accepted format (i.e. most used on the Internet).
